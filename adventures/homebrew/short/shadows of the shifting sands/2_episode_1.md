## Introduce Ibn Al-Hakim

The sandstorm rages around you, the stinging grains biting at your skin as you seek shelter near the oasis. In the midst of the chaos, you spot an old man, seated on a weathered rug, seemingly untouched by the tempest. As you approach, he looks up, revealing eyes that gleam with a mixture of wisdom and weariness.

As you settle into the makeshift shelter, the old man continues, a faint smile on his face.

> "Stories, they say, are the only currency the desert accepts without question. So, what brings you into the heart of this sandy maze? A thirst for adventure, a need to escape something, or perhaps just a wanderer lost in the dance of the dunes?"

He waits, giving each of you a moment to share your tales.

> "Ah, the desert is a canvas, and we are but brushstrokes upon it. Me? I find solace in the winds, solace in the quiet moments between the storms. There's wisdom in silence, and the desert, she's a master of it."

His eyes glint with a mixture of melancholy and fondness.

> "But enough about an old man's musings. Tell me, travelers, who are you in this vast sea of sand? What whispers carried you here, and what stories do you seek in return?"

He leans back, hands resting on his knees, a picture of serene curiosity.

> "Maybe there's a connection in our tales. The desert weaves its threads in mysterious ways, after all."

The storm outside seems to quiet for a moment, giving space for your responses. The old man's eyes linger on each of you, patient and expectant.

As you begin to share bits of your own stories, Ibn Al-Hakim listens intently, nodding at times as if savoring the flavor of each word. When there's a lull in the conversation, he speaks again, his voice carrying the weight of a genuine tale.

> "Ah, stories, my friends. They're like the grains of sand, countless and sometimes slipping through your fingers. Now, about this quest, let me weave it for you in the language of the desert."

He takes a moment, as if choosing the right words.

> "In the heart of this vast sea of sands, there lies a treasureâ€”an artifact known as the Orb of Al'Mazhar. A tiny globe, older than the oldest dunes, carrying whispers of forgotten wisdom."

His gaze grows distant, as if looking into the past.

> "But, alas, the desert is a harsh custodian. A figure cloaked in shadows, they call him the Shadow Sultan, swept in and spirited away the Orb. Not for noble reasons, mind you. He craves power, the kind that bends minds and casts the world in eternal twilight."

His eyes lock onto yours, a gravity to his words.

> "So, here we are, in the midst of this storm, where tales are born and sometimes lost. I need heroes, not champions in gleaming armor, but those who can navigate the shadows, understand the language of the sands, and retrieve that stolen whisper of wisdom."

He leans in a bit closer, his eyes searching yours.

> "This isn't just about stopping a villain. It's about preserving a piece of the desert's soul, keeping its secrets out of the wrong hands. Are you the ones the dunes have whispered to? Will you be the ones to face the shadows?"

His gaze is earnest, and the wind outside seems to echo the weight of his words. The choice, now, is yours.

The old man leans back, letting the weight of his words settle on the sands around you. The wind howls outside, but within this small refuge, there's a silence pregnant with the gravity of a choice.

> "I don't promise you riches or glory. This is no grand tapestry of destiny I'm laying out. It's a simple tale of shadows and a stolen whisper. But sometimes, my friends, it's the simple tales that echo through the ages."

He looks at each of you in turn, his gaze lingering a moment longer on your eyes.

> "You might find yourselves in the hidden folds of the City of Veiled Mirages, where illusions dance and secrets are wrapped in silk. You'll face the Djinn, guardians of wisdom, courage, and compassion. Earn their blessings, for they're the keys to the city."

His eyes flicker, a glint of challenge in them.

> "Then, the Sultan's palace. The heart of the storm. He's no common thief, this Shadow Sultan. Dark magic wraps around him like a shroud. It won't be a clash of swords alone. It'll be a dance of shadows and whispers."

He leans back, his gaze wandering to the storm outside, as if seeing something beyond the veil of sand.

> "But remember, heroes are not made in grand halls or atop mountains. They're made in the quiet moments, in the choices that echo through eternity. This quest might just be a collection of those moments."

The wind outside seems to subside, as if the desert itself holds its breath, waiting for your decision. Ibn Al-Hakim's eyes are filled with a quiet hope.

> "So, my friends, what say you? Will you be the tempest that unravels the Shadow Sultan's schemes, or will you let your tales be swallowed by the ever-shifting sands?"

The choice is yours, and the desert, with all its secrets, awaits your answer.

Here are some hints that Ibn Hakim can give to direct the players towards a certain area:

- **Dijnn of Courage**
    - This Dijnn has been sealed away in some temple, go search various temples to find him

- **Dijnn of Wisdom**
    - This Dijnn remains among various nomadic tribes. He blends in as a commoner planting the seeds of mischevious. Talk to the locals to hunt him down

- **Dijnn of Compassion**
    - This Dijnn is the gaurdian of the city itself and is the Sultan's slave. He was once a kindered spirit that has been subjugated to do evil's will.
    - Visit him last, as we know where he will be.

## Reaching the Ruins

After some time of travelling and marching towards a perpetual sand storm that is presumablye the City of Veiled Mirage. The players encounter their first 

### Storage Building:
>: The storage building, now partially buried beneath the shifting sands, once served as the heart of the ancient civilization's trade and sustenance. The walls, adorned with intricate carvings of desert life, depict scenes of prosperous harvests and bustling market activity. Barrels and crates, now weathered and empty, hint at a time when this structure bustled with the wealth of the desert's bounty.

###  Outdoor Meeting Grounds:
>: The outdoor meeting grounds, an expansive open area surrounded by weathered stone benches, served as a communal space for gatherings, celebrations, and important announcements. Faded murals on the walls depict scenes of unity, with people from diverse backgrounds coming together under the open desert sky. The central stone dais, now cracked and worn, once held a statue that stood as a symbol of their collective strength.

###  Small House:
>: This small house, almost entirely consumed by the sands, was likely a residence for someone of importance in the ancient society. The walls bear the marks of intricate tile patterns, remnants of a time when this dwelling was adorned with vibrant colors. A partially buried chest suggests that there might be forgotten treasures within, waiting to be discovered by those who dare to delve into the past.

###  Statue:
>: The statue at the center of the meeting grounds, now weathered and eroded, depicts a figure with outstretched arms, welcoming all who enter. Its face, worn smooth by centuries of wind and sand, holds an enigmatic expression. Inscriptions at its base, partially obscured by time, suggest that it once represented a revered leader or deity in the civilization.

###  Broken Sundial:
>: The broken sundial, now a shattered relic at the edge of the ruins, once measured time under the relentless desert sun. The base is adorned with symbols representing celestial events and constellations, hinting at the ancient civilization's fascination with the stars. The broken pieces, scattered like forgotten memories, evoke a sense of temporal disarray.

###  Pit:
>: A deep pit in the ground, surrounded by remnants of a collapsed structure, reveals a subterranean chamber that served as a clandestine storage vault. As the party peers into the darkness, glimpses of forgotten treasures, ancient parchments, and the gleam of a long-lost artifact can be seen. The echoes of whispers from the past suggest that this pit was sealed for a reason.

###  Small Broken Bridge:
>: The small broken bridge spans a narrow chasm, its archaic design suggesting it once connected different sections of the ruins. The chasm below reveals remnants of what might have been a waterway, now dried and filled with sand. The broken bridge, a metaphor for fractured connections, challenges the party to find new paths and overcome obstacles in their journey.

###  Small Temple Entrance:
>: The entrance to a small temple, its once-grand doors now half-buried, leads into a sacred space adorned with faded frescoes depicting rituals and ceremonies. The temple's walls echo with the whispers of ancient prayers and the scent of long-extinguished incense. The entrance, marked by weathered symbols of protection, hints at the sanctity that lies within the temple's depths, waiting to be explored.

## The Garuda Temple

### Entrance:
> The entrance to the ancient temple is adorned with ornate carvings depicting tales of creation and divine interventions. The air within carries a hushed stillness, and the walls seem to absorb the sound, creating an atmosphere of reverence. A dim glow emanates from long-forgotten braziers, casting flickering shadows that dance across the sacred symbols etched into the stone floor. The heavy doors, aged and adorned with mystical symbols, creak slightly as if welcoming those who dare to enter.

### Large Center Statue:
> Dominating the center of the temple is a monumental statue of a deity with a goat's head, its eyes fixed in an eternal gaze. The deity stands proudly in front of two grand sarcophagi, each adorned with chains that stretch across the temple floor. The chains seem to be both a symbolic and practical element, as though binding something within. The statue's eyes, once likely adorned with precious gems, now hold an emptiness that sends a shiver down the spines of those who behold it.

### Outside Skirt:
> The outside skirt of the temple, a corridor encircling the central chamber, is lined with alcoves that house remnants of offerings and artifacts. Faded tapestries tell tales of the deity's exploits, with scenes of both creation and destruction. The air here carries a subtle scent of incense, lingering from the ancient rituals that once filled this space. As the party moves along the skirt, they notice carvings depicting celestial events, suggesting a connection between the deity and the cosmic forces.

### Far End Exit:
> The far end of the temple leads to a smaller exit, marked by weathered symbols of protection and purification. Beyond the exit lies a pathway leading into the unknown expanses of the desert. The threshold seems to shimmer with a faint, ethereal light, and the air here carries a sense of release, as if the temple itself yearns for those within to venture forth. The exit, framed by the silhouette of distant dunes, beckons the party to step out into the shifting sands, their journey through the temple leaving them with a mix of awe and uncertainty.
