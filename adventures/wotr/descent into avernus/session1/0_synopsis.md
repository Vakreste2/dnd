## Introduction:
The adventure begins at the town square where a concert is going on celebrating the arrival of the Grand Duke of Baldurs Gate: **Ulder Ravengard**. However, the High Overseer of Eltruel, Thavius Kreeg, is on his way from Baldurs Gate so he isn't here for the occasion. The two twin cities have been at odds with each other but today marks one of the first diplomatic missions between the them. Many native Eltruel residents have come to give their glad tidings and welcome the foreign diplomat. Many adventurers have also come as cult activities have risen in the area. Today is a fun and joyous occasion!
## Adventure Hook:
After a rousing speech by Ulder Ravengard, another man approaches on stage. He begins  asking the crowd for any potential volunteers to help on a cultist mission against the Cult of the Dragon. The man is Ontharr Frume, a paladin of Torm and leader of the Order of the Gauntlet. Alongside him is Gideon Lightward, a priest of Lathander. They announce:

> Ontharr Frume, a paladin in the Order of the Gauntlet, pounds his fist against the podium, calling the crowd to order. He begins to speak: “My friends, I am glad to see you gathered here today to discuss the growing threat of the Cult of the Dragon. We have received troubling news that the cult has burned down the town of Greenest to the south. There are rumors now that the cult has become bold enough to even conduct rituals in the Elturgard Woods due north of here. “Together, we can deal a swift blow to the Cult of the Dragon by attacking their forces while they scheme in our local woods. I say we put aside our own squabbles and act. What say you?”

## The Quest: 
Ontharr Frume suspects the Cult of the Dragon is transporting treasure to Baldur’s Gate for onward movement north. He wants the characters to find the cult in the Elturgard Woods and capture a cultist to learn more information. He also believes characters can use cult garbs as a way to infiltrate the Cult of the Dragon in Baldur’s Gate.
## Main Objectives

1. **Investigate the Cult of the Dragon's Activities**: The characters are tasked with investigating the activities of the Cult of the Dragon in the Elturgard Woods, where it is suspected that the cult is conducting rituals and transporting treasure.

2. **Capture a Cultist for Interrogation**: One of the primary objectives is to capture a member of the Cult of the Dragon. The captured cultist will provide valuable information about the cult's operations and plans.

3. **Infiltrate the Cult of the Dragon**: Using cult garbs and any acquired knowledge, the characters must infiltrate the Cult of the Dragon to gain further intelligence and potentially disrupt their operations from within.

## Conclusion
By accomplishing these objectives, the characters will play a crucial role in combating the growing threat posed by the Cult of the Dragon. Their efforts will not only thwart the cult's immediate plans but also support the broader diplomatic mission between Baldur's Gate and Eltruel, fostering cooperation and easing tensions between the two cities.
